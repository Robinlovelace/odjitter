# Abstract

Origin-destination (OD) datasets are often represented as ‘desire lines’
between zone centroids. This paper presents a ‘jittering’ approach to
pre-processing and conversion of OD data into geographic desire lines
that (1) samples unique origin and destination locations for each OD
pair, and (2) splits ‘large’ OD pairs into ‘sub-OD’ pairs. Reproducible
findings, based on the open source odjitter Rust crate, show that route
networks generated from jittered desire lines are more geographically
diffuse than route networks generated by ‘unjittered’ data. We conclude
that the approach is a computationally efficient and flexible way to
simulate transport patterns, particularly relevant for modelling active
modes. Further work is needed to validate the approach and to find
optimal settings for sampling and disaggregation.

# Questions

Origin-destination (OD) datasets are widely used in transport planning
to efficiently represent aggregate travel behavior. Despite the
emergence of ‘big data’ sources such as massive GPS datasets, OD data
continues to play an established — if not central — role in
21<sup>st</sup> century transport planning and modelling. Recent
applications range from analysis of the evolution of urban activity and
shared mobility services over time (e.g. Shi et al. 2019; Li et al.
2019) to inference of congestion and mode split (Bachir et al. 2019; Gao
et al. 2021).

<!-- Perhaps in part because they are so well established, comparatively few recent research papers have explored new methods for processing OD datasets. -->

There has been much written on optimal zoning systems for and geographic
representations of OD data (e.g. Openshaw 1977; Boyce and Williams
2015). Recent papers have presented new methods for OD dataset
validation (Alexander et al. 2015), aggregation (He et al. 2018; Liu et
al. 2021), disaggregation (Katranji et al. 2016) and location of
‘connectors’ joining zone center points (centroids) with the surrounding
network (Jafari et al. 2015). Broadly, there are two approaches to
converting OD data into geographic representations for transport
modelling:

1.  Centroid to centroid representations, a common approach involving
    the simplifying assumption that all trip destinations and origins
    can be represented by (sometimes population weighted or aggregated)
    zone centroids (Guo and Zhu 2014; Martin et al. 2018).
2.  Subdividing zones (also referred to as transport analysis zones,
    TAZ) at which data is available to subzones centroids (Opie,
    Rowinski, and Spasovic 2009) or ‘centroid connectors’ or simply
    ‘connectors’ “between trip ends and zonal anchors” using stochastic
    or deterministic approaches (Leurent, Benezech, and Samadzad 2011;
    Friedrich and Galster 2009).

In this paper we present a new approach which, unlike established
approaches which convert centroid based desire lines to routes and then
route networks (Morgan and Lovelace 2020), allows the user to adjust
start and end locations based on variables such as transport network
density, residential density or size of commercial buildings acting as
trip attractors.
<!-- The results, represented as 'jittered desire lines' are more spatially diffuse than desire lines that go from and to zone centroids. -->
This ‘jittering’ approach is flexible, enabling the user to adjust the
level of disaggregation, the location of start and end points from which
disaggregate OD pairs are sampled, and weights representing the
importance of different trip ‘originators’ and ‘attractors’.
<!-- appropriate start points and trip attractors, and weights highlighting the relative importance of different origin and destination points. -->

OD data jittering is a simple, transparent and flexible
pre-processing stage that aims to represent the diffuse nature of travel
patterns. This is particularly important when designing for active
travel (Buehler and Dill 2016), explaining the choice of input data to
illustrate the technique in this paper: it was developed in response to
feedback from Edinburgh City Council (who funded a project based on the
research) that route networks based on the Propensity to Cycle Tool
approach (Lovelace et al. 2017) were too sparse. Jittered OD data can be
used with existing transport modelling workflows developed around
centroid-based methods, as the basis of route network assignment, uptake
modelling, and route network generation workflows (Morgan and Lovelace
2020). <!-- todo: add flow diagram --> We refer to the approach as
jittering, which means adding random noise for data visualization
(Wickham 2016).

<!-- In this paper we outline such methods and their uses, demonstrating how jittering can be used to create more diffuse and accurate estimates of movement at the level of segments ('flows') on transport network, with minimal computational overheads compared with the computationally intensive process of route calculation ('routing') or processing large GPS datasets. -->
<!-- Long version of paper: -->

<!-- # Origin-destination data {#od} -->
<!-- First, a description of the utility of OD data in contemporary policy contexts, and definitions, are in order. -->
<!-- An example of the utility of OD data, and the utility of open access (anonymised and aggregtated) OD data in particular, is Propensity to Cycle Tool (PCT), first launched nationally across England in 2017 [@lovelace_propensity_2017]. -->
<!-- The PCT provides a strong and consistent evidence-base that local authorities across England and Wales are using to inform strategic Local Cycling and Walking Plans. -->
<!-- Based on OD data --- initially for commuting trips only but subsequently also based on travel to school data [@goodman_scenarios_2019] --- the tool visualises cycling potential at zone, desire line, route and route network levels, and is being used by government, consultancy and public/advocacy stakeholders nationwide [@lovelace_open_2020]. -->
<!-- The PCT makes open OD data 'come to life' by converting a 'haystack' of data into meaningful insights into currently cycling levels and future potential, highlighting the need to invest in cohesive networks of cycling interventions, as illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:haystack). -->
<!-- The PCT is available for use by local authorities, consultancies, cycling advocacy groups, academic researchers and members of the public. -->
<!-- Subsequent work building on the tool has been used to prioritise investment in active transport in the wake of the coronavirus pandemic [@lovelace_methods_2020]. -->
<!-- Comparable tools have yet to be developed and deployed publicly in most other countries. -->
<!-- With the exception of regionally specific models using software such as sDNA [@cooper_using_2017] (the results of which are usually not in the public domain) and bespoke city-specific models [@larsen_build_2013; @zhang_prioritizing_2014], there are few large scale tools using OD data that are free for public use that we are aware of. -->
<!-- In this context, this paper outlines methods to add further value to OD data through processes of disaggregating OD data and 'jittering' to increase the density of route networks arising from the conversion of OD data into route network outputs of the kind illustrated in Figure \@ref(fig:haystack). -->

The jittering approach presented in this paper was motivated by the
following question:

> How can OD data representing trips between large geographic zones be
> used more effectively, to generate diffuse route networks of current
> or potential flow to inform local interventions?

<!-- Our hypothesis is that jittering leads to more effective use of OD data in transport planning. -->
<!-- Before describing the approach to answer this question, some definitions are in order: -->
<!-- , it is worth briefly defining OD data: datasets that consist of: -->
<!-- - **Origins**: locations of trip departure, typically stored as ID codes linking to zones -->
<!-- - **Destinations**: trip destinations, also stored as ID codes linking to zones -->
<!-- - **Attributes**: the number of trips made between each 'OD pair' and additional attributes such as route distance between each OD pair -->
<!-- - **Jittering**: The combined process of 'splitting' OD pairs representing many trips into multiple 'sub OD' pairs (disaggregation) and assigning origins and destinations to multiple unique points within each zone -->

# Methods

<!-- The methods described in this paper were developed to support a project to support Edinburgh City Council with their strategic cycle network planning activity. -->
<!-- To understand the method and results it makes sense to start by introducing the case study area. -->
<!-- ## A synthetic example: synthetic zones -->
<!-- ## Real world example: Edinburgh -->

The approach was developed to support public sector transport planning
in Edinburgh, UK. The original study area was Edinburgh City Council, a
major economic hub with ambitious
[plans](https://www.edinburgh.gov.uk/downloads/file/30073/active-travel-investment-programme-update-october-2021)
for investment in active travel, making evidence to support investment
where it will be most beneficial key. For the purposes of this study we
focus on a comparatively small area around central Edinburgh. We focus
in this paper on walking trips in this central area because much
research into route networks has focused on cycling and, because walking
trips tend to be short, they create a need to convert aggregated OD
datasets into diffuse route network representations of travel. Input
datasets developed for this paper can be downloaded using reproducible
code that accompanies the paper; see code at \[url to be included on
publication\] to fully reproduce the findings.

Beyond the zone data illustrated in Figure @ref(fig:od), the input
dataset consisted of open access OD data from the 2011 census. The OD
data can be represented as both tabular and, when start and end points
are assigned to centroids within each zone, as geographic entities, as
illustrated in a sample of three OD pairs presented in Figure
@ref(fig:od). To generate the route networks presented in Figure
@ref(fig:rneted) we used the OpenStreetMap Routing Machine (OSRM) with
the profile set to ‘foot’.
<!-- , which presents data at the zone and OD level for the top 3 OD pairs by number of interzonal travel between zones by all modes in Edinburgh in tabular and visual form. -->
<!-- The zone boundaries are based on open boundary data provided by data.gov.uk at the Middle Super Output Area (MSOA) level. -->
<!-- The population was 480,139 in the 2011 Census, 237,839 of whom were employed. -->
<!-- In the 2011 Census, 4.3% of residents of the area reported cycling to work, ranging from 1% in Intermediate Zone (IZ) Ferniehill, South Moredun and Craigour to 10% in the IZ Marchmont West. -->
<!-- There are 101 IZs (2001 definition) in the study region. -->

The key elements of the jittering approach outlined in this paper are
described in the following sub-sections, and are perhaps best understood
visually, as illustrated in each of the facetted maps in Figure
@ref(fig:jitters). The subfigures show the flexibility of approach, with
C) and D) demonstrating the use of vertices on the road network as start
and end points, building on the observation from spatial network
analysis that the density of the transport network is a reasonable proxy
for travel demand (Cooper 2018). Other refinements including weighted
subpoints could be used when data sources (e.g. building footprint
areas) are available.

## Sampling origin and destination points

<!-- ## Random sampling of origin and destination points -->

Key to jittering is ensuring that each trip starts and ends in a
different place. To do this, there must be ‘sub-points’ within each
zone, one for each trip originating and departing.

The simplest approach is simple random spatial sampling, as illustrated
in Figure @ref(fig:jitters) (B), which involves generating random
coordinate pairs.
<!-- testing to check if the point is contained withing the boundary of each zone from which points are required, and repeating the process until enough randomly located points have been created. -->
This approach has the advantages of simplicity, requiring no additional
datasets, but has the disadvantage that it may lead to unrealistic start
and end points, e.g. with trips being simulated to start in rivers and
in uninhabited wilderness areas.

<!-- ## Sampling origin and destination points from the transport network -->

To overcome the limitations of the simple random sampling approach, the
universe of possible coordinates from which trips can originate and end
can be reduced by providing another geographic input dataset. This
dataset could contain known trip attractors such as city centers and
work places, as well as tightly defined residential ‘subzones’. For
highly disaggregated flows in cases where accurate building datasets are
available, building footprints could also be used. A useful, and widely
available (Barrington-Leigh and Millard-Ball 2017), input for
subsampling is a transport road network, as illustrated in Figure
@ref(fig:jitters) (C). Additional refinements to the stochastic
selection of origin and destination based on weights relating to other
datasets are possible, as discussed in the final section.

## Disaggregation

Both of the jittering techniques outlined above generate more diffuse
route networks. However, a problem with OD datasets is that they are
often highly variable: one OD pair could represent 1 trip, while another
could represent 1000 trips. To overcome this problem a process of
disaggregation can be used, resulting in additional OD pairs within each
pair of zones. The results of disaggregation are illustrated
geographically in Figure @ref(fig:jitters) (D) and in terms of changes
to attributes, in Tables @ref(tab:dis1) and @ref(tab:dis2). As shown in
those tables, updated attributes can be calculated by dividing previous
trip counts by the number of OD pairs in the disaggregated
representation of the data, 5 in this case. To determine how many
disaggregated OD pairs each original OD pair is split into, a maximum
threshold was set: an OD pairs with a total trip count exceeding this
threshold (set at 100 in this case) is split into the minimum number of
disaggregated OD pairs that reduce the total number of trips below the
threshold.

# Findings

We found that jittering generates desire lines, and route networks, that
are more geographically diffuse than those resulting from the
established centroid-based approach. Figure @ref(fig:jittered514) shows
the use of simple random sampling and sampling nodes on transport
networks with reference to a real world example. While the simple random
sampling method of jittering presented in Figure @ref(fig:jittered514)
(B) may be appropriate in some specific cases, we advocate using
pre-defined sub-points. Using sub-points representing vertices on the
transport network, as illustrated in Figures @ref(fig:jittered514) C and
D, is supported by ‘spatial network analysis’ (SNA) approaches to
transport modelling (e.g. Cooper 2018). Weighted points representing
trip origins and destinations such as houses and commercial buildings
could also be used.

The results of converting the desire lines to routes and then route
networks are illustrated in Figure @ref(fig:rneted), which shows
progressively more diffuse networks. Greater disaggregation leads to
more diffuse networks as shown in Figure @ref(fig:rneted) (D).

The advantages of this approach include simplicity, low computational
cost and flexibility, with disaggregation (and network diffusion) levels
adjusted depending on requirements. Disadvantages relate to the use of
random number generators (RNG), which can reduce reproducibility
(overcome this by setting a ‘seed’, which makes the findings
reproducible) and influence findings (generate more than one set of
results and undertake testing to mitigate this drawback). Jittering is
particularly well suited to modelling walking and cycling, which require
diffuse networks. Taking disaggregation further, the approach can
generate one desire line per trip that could feed into agent based
models (ABM) such as A/B Street and MATSim (Carlino et al. 2022; Horni,
Nagel, and Axhausen 2016). Jittering has few input data requirements,
enabling its use in situations where sub-zones are unavailable.

<!-- Related methods of "centroid connector placement" have been developed and tested [@jafari_investigation_2015]. -->

This is, to the best of our knowledge, the first time that stochastic
spatial sampling and disagreggation of OD data has been described in a
single approach. The approach is implemented in the open source Rust
crate [`odjitter`](https://github.com/dabreegster/odjitter).
Implementations in R packages [`od`](https://itsleeds.github.io/od/) and
[`odjitter`](https://github.com/dabreegster/odjitter/tree/main/r), an
interface to the Rust implementation, enable others to reproduces the
findings, raising the possibility of interfaces to other languages.

The results also raise research questions, including:

-   Are the jittered results measurably better when compared with
    counter datasets on the network?
-   How would results from jittering OD data compare in other
    situations, e.g. to model motor traffic?
    <!-- - What additional refinements to the jittering techniques could generate more realistic disaggregated OD pairs, e.g. as an input into ABMs? -->
-   Which jittering settings (including sampling strategies and levels
    of disaggregation) represent the best ‘boom for buck’ in terms of
    network accuracy relative to computational requirements?
-   And can further refinements, for example sampling with weights to
    increase the proportion of trips associated with large buildings and
    commercial centers, or modifying disaggregation threshold values
    depending on variables such as zone size, improve results?

Before further refinements are made, we advocate empirical research to
validate the jittering approach outlined in this paper as a foundation
for further work on OD data pre-processing and disaggregation. Such
research requires case studies that have both good open OD data and good
observed travel behavior data, for example from manual and automatic
counters at point locations on the network (Lindsey et al. 2013) and
other sources of data such as trajectory datasets from GPS devices
(Zheng et al. 2016).
